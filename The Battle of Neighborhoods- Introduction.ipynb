This project is for those people who are looking for better locations to open a shopping mall. It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.\n\nThe major purpose of this project is to explore the City of Toronto neighbourhoods for the optimal location to open a shopping mall. To study and analyze the neighborhoods of Toronto city,  group them into similar clusters and analyze those clusters to gather meaningful information. That information can be used to find out locations that are more suitable to open a shopping mall. Good locations allow ready access, attract large numbers of customers, and increase the potential sales of stores in the mall."
